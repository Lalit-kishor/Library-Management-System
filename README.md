# Library-Management-System
Simple Restful API for managing a library system.
With the help of this API, one can interact with databse(I have used MongoDB in this case) and perform basic CRUD operations on book schema.
Major functions are - 
1. Retrieve all Books information(book name, author name, price) stored in database.
2. Retrieve a specific book using book id.
3. Add a new book in database using POST command.
4. Updating details of a specific book present in database.

   Alongwith this, error handling has been done properly.
