# Library-Management-System
Simple Restful API for managing a library system.
With the help of this API, one can interact with database(I have used MongoDB in this case) and perform basic CRUD operations on book schema.
Major functions are - 
1. Retrieve all Books information(book name, author name, price) stored in database using GET method.
2. Retrieve a specific book using book id.
3. Add a new book in database using POST method.
4. Updating details of a specific book present in database using PUT method.
5. Delete a specific using book id.

   Alongwith this, error handling has been done properly.

NOTE -> "books.js" file has been made inside "models" folder. Here "models" folder is not showing but in VS Code it is there.

I have used MongoDB database to store data and "Insomnia" API development platform to add books,update a book,ans delete a book.
